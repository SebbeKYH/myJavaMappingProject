My dear Isabelle,
Life in the city is very strange and I miss you
a lot. I have been here for 5 months and I am
having a hard time. My work as a carpenter
is difficult and my back hurts a lot. I will
make sure to send you some money soon. If there
is enough money you can come and visit me. We
can visit the local pub or the Zoo. I can
pick you up at the Airport. I love you.
Jonathan
